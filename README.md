# Forced Damped Oscillator Simulator (FDO_Sim)

**FDO_Sim** is a Python-based tool for simulating, analyzing, and visualizing the behavior of forced damped harmonic oscillators.

---

## Features

- Solves the second-order differential equation governing forced damped motion  
- Parameter estimation from real-world data using SciPy's `curve_fit`  
- Visualizes dynamic response, amplitude response, and phase lag  
- User-driven inputs for physical parameters and datasets  
- Save data tables as `.csv` files and plots as `.png` or `.pdf` files

---

## Included files

- `FDO_Sim.ipynb`: Interactive notebook version for step-by-step execution  
- `FDO_Sim.py`: Clean Python script version for direct use

---

## Demo CSV File

This repository includes one CSV file used to simulate experimental conditions:

- `FDO_Time&DisplacementData.csv`: Contains two essential columns - time and displacement - for simulating oscillator motion and estimating system parameters.

The file serves as input data for the simulations. Its specific purpose corresponds to the information conveyed by its filename, and the code structure reflects how it is utilized.

## Installation

No special installation required. Just clone the repo and run the notebooks/scripts in your Python environment.

---

## Usage

- Open `FDO_Sim.ipynb` in Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook.  
- Run cells step-by-step.  
- Modify inputs as needed.  
- Alternatively, run `FDO_Sim.py` as a script in your local Python setup.
